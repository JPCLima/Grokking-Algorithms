# Arrays Vs List

# Insert: Lists are better if you want to insert elements into the middle - O(1)
# Delete: List are better - O(1)
# Read: Arrays are better - O(1)

# Two way of access: 
# Random access - Can jump directly to the element (Arrays)
# Sequential access -  reading the elements one by one, starting at the first elemenet (Linkedlist)
